# Description

This task was made for SolveQ as the recruitment task. Finnaly, whole procces takes around 4 hours. Application allows user to type date on input, and after that it sends it to another component via props. <br><br>
The `CalculateDifference.tsx` is component for all calcs. It takes prop value, convert it into unixtimestamp format and starts counting how many minutes it takes, since user input the date<br><br>
